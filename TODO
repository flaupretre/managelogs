     If somebody can help on these or has other ideas, he's welcome !

* Convert the build system to autoconf

* Some features are still Unix-specific (like setuid/setgid), generally because
  the corresponding feature is not available in the APR library.
  The code should be more more portable, especially on Windows. Either the
  Unix-specific features have a Windows alternative, or they must be
  disabled on Windows.

* create directories when needed. Automatically destroy directories when
  backup files are purged.

* Integrate the same time-related features as cronolog (with a new 
  'storage (absolute/relative) path' argument), automatic rotation
  on pattern. Remember: cannot chdir() because of multiple output support.

* An option to display in readable form information about
  a log manager current state (mostly extracted from the status file).

* Use a more robust mutex-based mechanism for signals.

* An optional command to be launched when the program aborts on a fatal
  error. This command would receive the information on the error, and could
  connect with a monitoring system, send a trap...

* Another external script to be executed when managelogs gets a 'file system
  full' error (as it now survives it).

* Add a 'purge-delay' option. Tells a maximum time for log data to remain
  in the files. Adds a new purge condition.
