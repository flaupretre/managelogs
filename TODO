* Convert the build system to autoconf

* man page(s)

* create directories when needed. Automatically destroy directories when
  backup files are purged.

* Integrate the same time-related features as cronolog (with a new 
  'storage (absolute/relative) path' argument), automatic rotation
  on pattern. Remember: cannot chdir() because of multiple output support.

* An option to display in readable form some information about
  a log environment (mostly extracted from the status file).

* Use a more robust mechanism for signals, based on a mutex.
