* Convert the build system to autoconf

* create directories when needed. Automatically destroy directories when
  backup files are purged.

* Integrate the same time-related features as cronolog (with a new

  on pattern. Remember: cannot chdir() because of multiple output support.

* An option to display in readable form information about
  a log manager current state (mostly extracted from the status file).

* Use a more robust mutex-based mechanism for signals.
