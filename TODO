* Convert the build system to autoconf

* man page(s)

* create directories when needed. Automatically destroy directories when
  backup files are purged.

* Integrate the same time-related features as cronolog (with a new 
  'storage (absolute/relative) path' argument), especially automatic rotation
  on pattern. Remember: cannot chdir() as we also plan adding multiple output
  support. So, absolute storage path has to be computed and used for file
  access.

* Multiple outputs with different formats and limits. Would create several
  managers and write the data to all of them (would allow, for instance, to
  make a small amount of log available in plain form somewhere, while
  everything is stored in compressed format elsewhere. Shouldn't affect the
  library, just the main & options parts. Would require to supply the root path
  as an option on the command line.

* An option to display in readable form the information about
  a log environment (mostly extracted from the status file).
