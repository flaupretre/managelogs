                   managelogs installation instructions
                   ------------------------------------

* Prerequisites :

	- managelogs uses the Apache Portable Runtime library, provided with the
	  Apache web server. So, you need to install Apache
	  (available from http://httpd.apache.org).

	- you need the zlib library if you want managelogs to support gzip
	  compression. zlib is available from http://www.zlib.net

	- you need the bzip2 library if you want managelogs to support bzip2
	  compression. bzip2 is available from http://www.bzip.org

These software are provided pre-compiled on most platforms.

As far as I know, there is no requirement on the version of these libraries. The
versions I used here are :

	- APR 0.9.12 (included in Apache http server 2.0.59)
	- Zlib library 1.2.3
	- Bzip2 library 1.0.1

* Compiling

	- Edit the make.vars file in the base directory and modify the
	  'modifiable parameters' section according to your environment. This will
	  define where Apache, zlib, and bzip2 are installed, whether you want
	  zlib and bzip2 support, and compile options.

	- Run 'make'

* Installing

	- Run 'make install'. This will install :

		- the managelogs executable in <apache-path>/bin
		- the logmanager.h include file in <apache-path>/include
		- the logmanager library in <apache-path>/lib

* Architectures

The software was succesfully tested on the following environments :

	- Linux RHEL 3, 4, 5 (AS/ES, 32 & 64 bits)
	- Solaris 9
	- AIX 5.2
	- HP-UX 11.00
	- HP-UX 11.11

If you build and run it on other environments, please let me know, so I can
add them to this list.
