1.0:

* Fix problem with error_log when starting Apache : httpd starts a managelogs
  process, then forks and the forked process starts another managelogs. Then,
  the first process exits. So, by default, the pid file is overwritten and
  deleted by the first managelogs. And, as the status file does not exist
  when the second one starts, a new active file is created.
  Fixes :
    - In logmanager_destroy(), don't remove the pid file if it has been
      overwritten (if it does not contain our pid).
    - In logmanager_open(), dump status if the active file
      did not exist. So, when the second process gets in, it finds a status
      file and reopens the same active file.

* In file_get_contents(), the sizep argument was not returned. Also, make
  it optional (can be NULL).

* Add pid_path element in LOGMANAGER structure, so that it is not recomputed
  each time we need it.

* Replace APR_STATUS_IS_SUCCESS() macro as it is not defined in apr version 1.

* Cosmetic changes to suppress warnings in '-Wall' mode.

1.0rc1:

* First public release
