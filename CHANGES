1.1.0 :

* Added a '--rotate-cmd' option (a command to be launched in background when
  a rotation occurs). Used primarily to gather statistics.
  
* Additional protection against file system full errors (E_NOSPC). When such an
  error occurs during a data write operation, it is ignored, except if
  the '--enospc-abort' option is set. Ensures that a file system overflow
  does not cause Apache to abort.

* Modified the way memory pools are used. In the previous versions, only one
  global pool was used and, as the pool mechanism does not allow a block to be
  freed, this pool grew (not fast, but) indefinitely. We now use temporary
  pools where it is possible (when the alloc/free is local to a function), and
  persistent pools are created to store apr_file_t structures for open files.
  Each file has its own a private pool, so that it can be freed.

* Set lib directory under src

* Improved Makefiles

* Replace 'root_path' with 'base_path' everywhere in the code

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.1:

* Cosmetic changes

* Add man page

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0:

* Fix problem with error_log when starting Apache : httpd starts a managelogs
  process, then forks and the forked process starts another managelogs. Then,
  the first process exits. So, by default, the pid file is overwritten and
  deleted by the first managelogs. And, as the status file does not exist
  when the second one starts, a new active file is created.
  Fixes :
    - In logmanager_destroy(), don't remove the pid file if it has been
      overwritten (if it does not contain our pid).
    - In logmanager_open(), dump status if the active file
      did not exist. So, when the second process gets in, it finds a status
      file and reopens the same active file.

* In file_get_contents(), the sizep argument was not returned. Also, make
  it optional (can be NULL).

* Add pid_path element in LOGMANAGER structure, so that it is not recomputed
  each time we need it.

* Replace APR_STATUS_IS_SUCCESS() macro as it is not defined in apr version 1.

* Cosmetic changes to suppress warnings in '-Wall' mode.

1.0rc1:

* First public release
