I would like to thank the following people, whose development provided
a lot of ideas and inspiration while designing and developing managelogs:

* Ben Laurie <ben@algroup.co.uk> and Mladen Turk <mturk@mappingsoft.com> are
  the main authors of rotatelogs, the original Apache log rotation program.
  Their code was the base managelogs was developed from (even if almost nothing
  remains in the current version :).

* The Apache developers whose 'piped logging' feature allows managelogs to
  exist.

* Andrew Ford <A.Ford@ford-mason.co.uk> is the author of cronolog, an
  alternative to rotatelogs. Cronolog provides a lot of time-related features.
  More info on cronolog at http://cronolog.org

* and all the people, anonymous or not, who give a lot of time and effort to
  make free software a living and efficient reality...
